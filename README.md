# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This project was created for my friends and **anyone who enjoys music** as much as we do

Out of all my projects for learning, portfolio projects, this is the one I enjoyed the most and still get to use everyday.

I'm still updating UI/UX and may deploy it later for everyone to use on the internet, but I would have to get it switched out of development mode by the Spotify Web API; However, it's fully functional and you can still use it today!


## How To Get Started
### Step 1
- create a [Spotify Web API Account](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)
- in your profile create an app
- set the website uri to http: //localhost:5173
- set the redirect uri to http: //localhost:5173/api/callback

### Step 2
- fork the repo and download
- run "npm install"
- create a .env file
- set SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = to your Spotify Client ID in the Spotify Web API
- set SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = to your Spotify Client Secret in the Spotify Web API
- run "npm run dev"

### Step 3
- Have fun! **ðŸŽ¶**
