<h1>Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h1> 

<h3>This project was created for my friends and anyone who enjoys music as much as we do</h3>

Out of all my projects for learning, portfolio projects, etc this is the one I enjoyed the most and still get to use everyday.

I'm still updating UI/UX and may deploy it later for everyone to use on the internet, but I would have to get it switched out of development mode by the Spotify Web API; However, it's fully functional and you can still use it today!
